GetGrub
=======
Get Grub is a web application aimed at connecting those going out to grab late-night food, and those staying in, but wanting late-night food. It was developed at Platform Houston's inaugural hackathon!

How does Get Grub work?
-----------------------
Person A: It's 2AM. I'm starving. I want Whataburger but I don't want to drive, and Whataburger doesn't deliver.  
Person B: It's 2AM. I'm starving. I'm going out to get some Whataburger. What? I could make a few quick bucks picking up an extra honey butter chicken biscuit?  

Person B delivers food to Person A and money is exchanged.
